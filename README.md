# Arwing

Arwing's goal is to be a querying engine for finding interactions in a set of slippi replays.


## It aims to answer questions like:

- What do top foxes do after drilling pikachu?
- How do players DI out of chaingrabs?
- What does my bracket demon like to do out of laser?

## In the future it might point out when a player gets punished for:

- Missing L-cancels
- Not getting enough galint on ledgedash
- Getting stuck in shine
- And much much more!

### TODO
- Parsing can defo be faster
- Setup to parse directories, return the frame indices and games where interactions occur
- Export project clippi files
- Refine query system
    - Select stages
    - Parse only character or specifically for Player Name

- Create GUI App
    - Likely Tauri
